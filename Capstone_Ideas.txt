1. Analyze healthcare cost data nationwide using the IPPS Medicare cost data at data.gov. The costs for a given procedure vary wildly depending on location so I would like to look at how those costs vary by location and see if there are any patterns in the data.

2. Analyze the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that shows hospital admissions over 10 years and look at factors in readmission rates for diabetes patients. I would look at things like the length of stay and what tests were performed in order to predict the readmission rate.

3. Kaggle competition?
